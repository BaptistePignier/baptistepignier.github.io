# ðŸŽ“ - Jekyll Professional Resume

A simple and modern resume template, best fit for either **Academic CV (Curriculum Vitae)** or **Engineer Portfolio**.

![demo](https://i.ibb.co/HYshYc0/231232121.webp)

## Setup
Fork [this repository](https://github.com/byanko55/jekyll-professional-resume) or download the [source](https://github.com/byanko55/jekyll-professional-resume/releases) as a zip.

If you use as destination a repository named USERNAME.github.io, then your url will be https://USERNAME.github.io/.

### Update Profile
In `_config.yml`, you can modify personal info such as your photo, phone number, email, and other social accounts.

```yml
profile_img: assets/img/profile.webp
icon_img: assets/img/icon.webp

phone_number: 012-345-6789
address: City, Country
email: email@example.com
linkedin_username: linkedin
github_username: github
...

```

### Create a Topic

All resume information should be placed in a directory named '`_data`'. You can manage personal data in several groups separately, making a *Yaml* (`.yml`) file for each subject.

```
._data
â”œâ”€â”€ SUBJECT1.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ SUBJECT2.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ SUBJECT3.yml
...

```

For instance,

```
._data
â”œâ”€â”€ Awards.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Education.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Experience.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Languages.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Projects.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Publications.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Skills.yml
```

### Fill your infomation

Open the *Yaml* file which you created right before. 

* **subject**: title of a subject (ex., *Education*, *Work Experience*, *Skills*, and so on)
* **listing-order**: determines the display order (from top to bottom) of the subject
* **icon**: subject icon to be displayed
* **contents**: The details of each item are listed in `KEY`-`VALUE` pairs 

```yml
subject:
listing-order:
icon:
contents:
  - title: ITEM 1
    KEY: VALUE
    KEY: VALUE
    ...
  - title: ITEM 2
    KEY: VALUE
    ...
```

For a better understanding, see the example below.

```yml
subject: Education
listing-order: 1
icon: "/assets/img/graduation-cap.svg"
contents:
  - title: Stanfort University, MA in Computer Science
    description:
      - Development of algorithms for tracking the facial expressions
      - Optimizing parameter efficient fine tuning for fairness
    grade: "**GPA**: `4.1/4.3`"
    date: Mar. 2014 - Feb. 2016
  ...

```

The rendered output looks like this:

```
subject: Projects
listing-order: 3
icon: "/assets/img/clipboard-list.svg"
contents:
  - title: "ChatPPT ([https://chat.opena1.com/](https://chat.openai.com/))"
